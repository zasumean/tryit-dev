# TryIt.dev

TryIt.dev is a lightweight developer-focused playground that lets you experiment with command-line tools like `jq` directly in the browser.

##  About

This project started as a simple `jq` playground and will gradually grow into a multi-tool sandbox for developers. The idea is to give devs a quick way to try out tools like `jq`, `curl`, `regex`, etc., without installing anything locally.

Itâ€™s built with:
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Server-side API routes (to run tools like jq safely)

##  Features (Current)
- Paste JSON and run `jq` queries
- Save and reuse queries (stored locally in the browser)
- Clean, minimal interface for fast testing

##  Roadmap
- Add support for other tools (like `curl`, `regex`, `yq`, etc.)
- Shareable query links
- WebAssembly support for client-safe execution

## Deadline
- Hope to finish this side project by end of April 2025
